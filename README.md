# ALGORITHMS FOR THE TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM WITH RIDESHARING AND QUOTA

## Algorithms List

### Instructions

This project uses gurobi version 6.5, so the cmake files uses this version. If you want to use another version you must to change each `CMakeLists.txt` file on the folders, for instance: `exact/CMakeLists.txt`.

To run the code, you have to run the command `cmake .` on the folder that contains the 
`CMakeLists.txt` file.

### 1. Exact

	That algorithm uses gurobi solver. The math model was implemented here.
    

### 2. Heuristic
